--------------------- Current problems:

:: fret 13 off board
G#dim/Abdim does not work, only lights up notes before first fret13 note


:: Notes in chord list sometimes flats/sharps when display shows other version (written notes: all views)


:: subset :: Flats do not appear on fretboard when lit (written notes: whole only)
* Cm

:: Writing does not appear in lit frets (written notes: whole only)
* Cm7

:: Double sharps and flats appear on fretboard as next whole (written notes: whole only)
* Baug (F##)
* Cbm7 (Bbb, Ebb)

:: Fretboard click lights up fret but does not add writing unless a chord (eg Baug) is already selected



--------------------- No longer an issue due to other changes:

:: Sharps stay on fretboard when unlit (written notes: whole only)
* Dmaj -> Dmin
* B -> C
